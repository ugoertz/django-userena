  in `userena/mail.py` (#462).

## Version 1.4.0

Fixes and improvements:

- Python3.3 and Python3.4 support added.


## Version 1.3.2

Backwards incompatible changes:

- Creating new user always creates new empty userena profile (fixes bug from 1.3.1).


## Version 1.3.1

Backwards incompatible changes:

- When USERENA_ACTIVATION_REQUIRED = False, creating new user does not automatically
  create userena profile (bug).


## Version 1.2.2

Backwards incompatible changes:

- Changed backwards relationships names for Umessages contrib application from
  `to_user` to `um_to_user` and `from_user` to `um_from_user`.


## Version 1.2.0

Backwards incompatible changes:

- This version updates Userena to be able to use the new `User` model found in
  Django 1.5. This does require the django-guardion > 1.5-dev. To make this
  work, there is a `get_user_model` function in `userena/utils.py` which is used
  to get the correct `User` model.


## Version 1.1.2

Backwards incompatible changes:

- Activation view no longer contains username. If you override
  `userena/templates/userena/emails/activation_email_message.txt` and
  `userena/templates/userena/emails/confirmation_email_message_new.txt` be sure
  to remove username from the URL.


## Version 1.1

Backwards incompatible changes:

- Userena now requires Django >= 1.3 because of the use of class based views.


## Version 1.0.1

Backwards incompatible changes:

- Removed the ``user`` relationship outside ``UserenaBaseProfile`` model. This
  allows the user to define it's own relationship and fixes a conflict while
  running ``manage.py test``. To migrate, place the ``user`` field inside your
  profile model, instead of inheriting it from the ``abstract`` class.
